# Weather-Journal App Project
A Weather Journal App created to fulfill the specifications of project 4 for the Udacity Fend nanodegree program
## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

### Acknowledgments
 This project is based on the starter code provided by Udacity. I used some help from the internet to improve and add new css styles to the project. No JavaScript code is copied from others, but I did use the documentation to read more about how some functions work and how to invoke them with some options and i also used variations of code found on teaching sites to make it work. I tried to use the funtions that I've learnt in the course, although I know there may be more direct as well as  better and more functional approaches.

### Usage
Html web page ready to view on any type and size of web browser.

### Author
This work was done by Osunde Osarieme Naomi and submitted to the Udacity team as project no.4 in the udacity FEND Nanodegree progra

## Instructions for Use
